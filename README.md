# weather-prediction
• Developed a ML project that predict maximum temperature and rainfall of the next day from the
  previous data.
• Data from the John F. Kennedy airport used to train, test and predict the weather.
• Used Linear regression model, Ridge regression model to predict maximum temperature.
• Used Random forest classification and Support vector machine to predict rainfall for the next day.
• Tech used:- Jupyter Notebook, Panda, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Python, Linear regression, Ridge
  regression, Random forest, Support vector machine.
